# UBER
My attempt to create an App similar to UBER for booking cabs.\
In this App user would be able to book cabs within the radius of 5km and give driver an option to accept or reject the ride, if the ride will be accepted both client and driver will be sharing each others location in real-time. It will be an clone of one of the most trending app UBER!


### This App is supposed to have all these features :-
- Client and Driver Panel (giving different Signup Methods to both of them).
- Signin and Signup Users via Firebase.
- User Location Services via Apple Maps API.
- Search and Display Location for Client.
- Fetch UserData from Firebase API for User Profile Page.
- Sharing nearby drivers location to client in RealTime.
- Ability to request rides by Client and allow Driver to Accept or Reject the same.
- Show Driver and Client RealTime location of each other(only when Ride is accepted).
- Allow User to cancel a Ride if required.

(This are only the features I could think of while designing the App Structure, could add or remove some of them as per requirements)

(⭐️ this repository if you liked it.)
